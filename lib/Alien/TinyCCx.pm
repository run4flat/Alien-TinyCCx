=head1 NAME

Alien::TinyCCx - retrieve useful information about the Alien installation of tcc with
extended symbol tables

=head1 ALIEN SYNOPSIS

 use Alien::TinyCCx;
 
 
 ## libtcc location functions ##
 
 say 'The libtcc headers can be found in ',
     Alien::TinyCCx->libtcc_include_path;
 say 'The libtcc library can be found in ',
     Alien::TinyCCx->libtcc_library_path;
 
 
 ## tcc functions ##
 
 say 'The tcc executable can be found in ',
     Alien::TinyCCx->path_to_tcc;
 
 # Create a C file
 open my $out_fh, '>', 'test.c';
 print $out_fh <<'EOF';
 #include <stdio.h>
 
 int main() {
     printf("Good to go");
     return 1;
 }
 
 EOF
 close $out_fh;
 
 # Alien::TinyCCx ensures that the tcc executable is
 # in your PATH environment variable, so this Just Works:
 my $output = `tcc -run test.c`;

=head1 XS SYNOPSIS

If you want to build against F<libtcc>, then in your F<Build.PL> file you
should have something like this:

 use Module::Build;
 use Alien::TinyCCx;
 Module::Build->new(
     ...
	 configure_requires => {
         'Alien::TinyCCx' => 0,
         ...
	 },
     build_requires => {
         'Alien::TinyCCx' => 0,
         ...
     },
     requires => {
         'Alien::TinyCCx' => 0,
         ...
     },
     needs_compiler => 1,
     dynamic_config => 1,
     include_dirs => [Alien::TinyCCx->libtcc_include_path],
     extra_linker_flags => [Alien::TinyCCx->MB_linker_flags],
 )->create_build_script

At the top of the Perl module that provides the Perl libtcc interface:

 # My/C/Tiny/Interface.pm
 use Alien::TinyCCx;  # set LD_LIBRARY_PATH, PATH, etc
 
 BEGIN {
     our $VERSION = '0.02';
     use XSLoader;
     XSLoader::load 'My::C::Tiny::Interface', $VERSION;
 }

In your XS file that interfaces with libtcc:

 /* Usual Perl XS suspects */
 #include "EXTERN.h"
 #include "perl.h"
 #include "XSUB.h"
 #include "ppport.h"
 
 /* This is the important one */
 #include "libtcc.h"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module ensures that you have a copy of the Tiny C Compiler with
extended symbol table management accessible
to your Perl code, ensures that F<tcc> is in your path after saying
C<use Alien::TinyCCx>, ensures that F<libtcc> is in your C<LD_LIBRARY_PATH>
for Unixen and C<PATH> for Windows, and provides some functions for
identifying those paths and building against them.

This module is blissfully unaware of any other F<tcc> installations on your
system and it does not install F<tcc> into a generically usable location.
Rather, it installs it into a Perl-specific location. The basic idea is that
this Perl module should not interfere with your non-Perl stuff.

The provided path functions include:

=over

=item path_to_tcc

gives the full path to the directory containing the F<tcc> executable

=item libtcc_include_path

gives the full path to the diretory containing F<libtcc.h>

=item libtcc_library_path

gives the full path to the directory containing F<libtcc.dll> or F<libtcc.a>

=back

If you want to link against F<libtcc>, you will need to include C<Alien::TinyCC>
in your F<.pm> file that loads your XS bindings, to ensure that the
C<PATH> or C<LD_LIBRARY_PATH> is properly set. Then, in your F<Build.PL>
file, you can use

=over

=item MB_linker_flags

gives the proper list of arguments to link against F<libtcc>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

This module provides the Tiny C Compiler. To learn more about this great
project, see L<http://bellard.org/tcc/> and
L<http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/tinycc>.

To learn more about Alien Perl distributions in general, read the L<Alien>
manifesto.

This library was built to distributed my fork of the Tiny C Compiler with
extended symbol tables, which I needed to implement L<C::Blocks>.

This library is based on C<Alien::TinyCC>.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The tcc developers have made this a very easy project to wrap up. They even
had the Windows install command nicely packaged up! How amazing!
