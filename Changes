0.07  DAY, MTH D, YYYY

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * New and improved patching for Mac and NetBSD
  
  * Added tentative support for Solaris

0.06  Sat, Aug 1, 2015

  * Forked from v0.05 of Alien::TinyCC; the source repository is now my local
    fork so that I can distribute the extended symbol table API.
  
  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * Include functions to generate ExtUtils::MakeMaker arguments, ported from
    Alien::TinyCC.

0.05  Mon, Sep 2, 2013

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * The patch function in the build system now sets execution bit on all new
    files. This fixes the build issues for BSD boxes, which patch configure,
    rendering it non-executable.
  
  [OTHER]
  
  * Added Travis CI integration.

0.04  Thu, Aug 29, 2013

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * Created a general patching function, used now by Windows and BSD build
    systems, and used to patch the test files for all systems.
  
  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Patched MidnightBSD detection.
  
  * Added -fPIC flag for systems whose Perl was compiled with it.
  
  * Fixed stdarg.h issues for older gcc header collections.
  
  * Added method to detect, and patch if necessary, the proper path for
    ucontext.h (either #include <ucontext.h> or #include <sys/ucontext.h>).
  
  [OTHER]
  
  * Added a commit hook (and instructions in the README for activation) which
    should help keep this file up-to-date. :-)
  
  * Updated the dist Build command to reset the files under src/ before
    building the dist.
  
  * Added various dev Build commands to make it easier to get a clean setup.

0.03  Sun, Aug 25, 2013

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * Added work-around for Mac smoke tester's erroneous configuration.
  
  * Included tcc's test suite.
  
  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Tweaked BSD make invocation.
  
  * Fixed Windows compiler detection code.

0.02  Wed, Aug 21, 2013

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Fixed incorrect MANIFEST issues and other build system problems.

0.01  Wed, Aug 21, 2013

  Initial release!
  
  * Compiles and installs tcc on Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX.
  
  * Installs to a sharedir location, and is Perl-specific.
  
  * Provides simple mechanisms for use in Build.PL files.
  
  * "use Alien::TinyCC" modifies PATH so tcc can be found.
