0.11  Ddd, Mth #, 201#

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * BSDs were switched to use cc, but that is clang (at least on some
    BSDs) so we need to add the heinous-gnu-extensions flag.
  
  * Add patch for Mac OSX to #define _VA_LIST_T. Macs were hitting trouble
    with incompatible preprocessor definitions. If the macros and internal
    definitions had all been expanded, the definitions for variadic function
    lists would have been the same, but tcc doesn't know that.
  
  [OTHER]
  
  * The test suite has been made robust against compiler warnings. It now
    searches for expected printouts as substrings of the obtained printouts.

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Fix 64-bit cpu specification for call to configure on Macs.

  [DEPENDENCIES]
  
  * Recently, extended symbol table work was brought back up-to-date with
    the latest mob branch of tcc. The github branch with this work is
    called 'mobx'. This Alien package now uses mobx as its subrepo.

0.08  Sun, Apr 24, 2016

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * Include new exsymtab inline test files.
  
  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Use "cc" instead of "gcc" on BSDs
  
  * MANIFEST now includes all necessary mingw header files in the git
    repo. Somehow I forgot to include these after I figured out which
    ones needed to be added.

0.07  Wed, Dec 2, 2015

  * Updated to latest work including inline support for inline functions.
  
  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * New and improved patching for Mac and NetBSD
  
  * Added tentative support for Solaris
  
  * Remove stack protection on Linuxes; this was causing trouble on
    recent vintages of Ubuntu.

0.06  Sat, Aug 1, 2015

  * Forked from v0.05 of Alien::TinyCC; the source repository is now my local
    fork so that I can distribute the extended symbol table API.
  
  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * Include functions to generate ExtUtils::MakeMaker arguments, ported from
    Alien::TinyCC.

0.05  Mon, Sep 2, 2013

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * The patch function in the build system now sets execution bit on all new
    files. This fixes the build issues for BSD boxes, which patch configure,
    rendering it non-executable.
  
  [OTHER]
  
  * Added Travis CI integration.

0.04  Thu, Aug 29, 2013

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * Created a general patching function, used now by Windows and BSD build
    systems, and used to patch the test files for all systems.
  
  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Patched MidnightBSD detection.
  
  * Added -fPIC flag for systems whose Perl was compiled with it.
  
  * Fixed stdarg.h issues for older gcc header collections.
  
  * Added method to detect, and patch if necessary, the proper path for
    ucontext.h (either #include <ucontext.h> or #include <sys/ucontext.h>).
  
  [OTHER]
  
  * Added a commit hook (and instructions in the README for activation) which
    should help keep this file up-to-date. :-)
  
  * Updated the dist Build command to reset the files under src/ before
    building the dist.
  
  * Added various dev Build commands to make it easier to get a clean setup.

0.03  Sun, Aug 25, 2013

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * Added work-around for Mac smoke tester's erroneous configuration.
  
  * Included tcc's test suite.
  
  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Tweaked BSD make invocation.
  
  * Fixed Windows compiler detection code.

0.02  Wed, Aug 21, 2013

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Fixed incorrect MANIFEST issues and other build system problems.

0.01  Wed, Aug 21, 2013

  Initial release!
  
  * Compiles and installs tcc on Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX.
  
  * Installs to a sharedir location, and is Perl-specific.
  
  * Provides simple mechanisms for use in Build.PL files.
  
  * "use Alien::TinyCC" modifies PATH so tcc can be found.
